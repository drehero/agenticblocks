    "# MAS-Zero: Multi-Agent Systems with Zero Supervision\n",
    "\n",
    "MAS-Zero: Designing Multi-Agent Systems with Zero Supervision is a [paper by Ke et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14996) which was one of the first works to explore designing Mulit-Agent Systems (MAS) in an unsupervised manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "While other automated design systems for MAS (e.g. ADAS) often rely on validation data to inform the design process and are designing solutions for a whole task, MAS-Zero automatically designs a solution for each problem instance without relying on any additional validation data.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](assets/mas-zero.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "MAS-Zero is made of 3 steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **MAS-Init**: Entry point to MAS-Zero in which a set of established human-designed strategies (e.g. Chain of Thought, Self Consitency, Debate, Self-Refine) are run to generate initial candidate solutions.\n",
    "2. **MAS-Evolve**: MAS-Evolve is an iterative process which consists of two alternating phases - meta-design and meta-feedback. The goal of this stage is to learn about the strengths of the component agents and refine the solution.\n",
    "    1. **meta-design**: the meta agent decomposes the question into subtasks and proposes a MAS based on the building blocks and any accumulated experience from prior iterations.\n",
    "    2. **meta-feedback**: The designed MAS as well as its output, including all intermediate output are evaluated against the following two criteria:\n",
    "        * Solvability: Requires that each sub-task is independently and completely solvable.\n",
    "        * Completeness: Requires that the complete set of sub-tasks covers all necessary information from the original input, ensuring that the answers to the sub-tasks can be aggregated to a the original task.\n",
    "    3. The natural language feedback provided in the meta-feedback step is added to an experience library and added to the input of the meta-design stage in subsequent rounds.\n",
    "3. **MAS-Verify**: Each round of MAS-Evolve produces multiple intermediate outputs and one candidate answer. After multiple rounds of MAS-Evolve the final answer to the task is selected from the candidate answers and the answers from the initial building blocks. In order to do so all answers are first ranked by their frequency, then clearly invalid answers are filtered out and finally the best answer is selected from the remaining candidates.\n",

However, we'll proceed with the assumption that P3 encodes with \\\\((x_c, p_c)\\\\) as given.\\n\\nFor a Bell measurement between the 1st and 2nd modes (encoded by P1 and P2), and another between the 3rd and 4th modes (encoded by P2 and P3), the measurements would effectively involve the differences and sums of the quadratures.\\n\\n- Between 1st and 2nd modes: \\\\((x_a - x_b, p_a - p_b)\\\\)\\n- Between 3rd and 4th modes, considering P3's encoding as \\\\((x_c, p_c)\\\\): \\\\((x_b - x_c, p_b - p_c)\\\\) or \\\\((x_c - x_b, p_c - p_b)\\\\) depending on the convention used. However, the question seems to ask for the output based on how the parties encode, which suggests looking at the differences in the displacements applied by the parties.\\n\\nConsidering the above and the options provided:\\n- **A) \\\\((x_a - x_b, p_a - p_b), (x_b - x_c, p_b - p_c)\\\\)**: This matches the expected form of the measurement outcomes based on the differences in the displacements applied by the parties, which is consistent with how Bell measurements work in continuous variable systems.\\n\\nThe other options (B, C, D) do not correctly represent the expected outcomes of a Bell measurement in this context, as they either add the quadratures (which would be more relevant to a different type of measurement or encoding scheme) or mix the addition and subtraction in a way that doesn't align with the standard approach to Bell measurements in continuous variable quantum information processing.\\n\\nTherefore, based on the understanding of the process and the typical outcome of a Bell measurement in continuous variable systems, the correct answer would be:\\n\\n**A) \\\\((x_a - x_b, p_a - p_b), (x_b - x_c, p_b - p_c)\\\\)**\\n\\nThis assumes a standard approach to encoding and measurement in continuous variable quantum information protocols and corrects for the apparent inconsistency in the problem statement regarding the encoding of the 3rd mode.\",\n",

Each party encodes their information using a displacement operator $D(\\\\alpha)$, where $\\\\alpha = x + ip$, with $x$ and $p$ representing amplitude and phase, respectively. The encoding is such that the 2nd and 3rd modes are encoded by party P2, and the 1st and 4th modes are encoded by parties P1 and P3, respectively.\\n\\n## Step 2: Apply the encoding to the modes\\nGiven the encoding scheme, we can represent the encoding of each mode as follows:\\n- 1st mode (P1): $D(\\\\alpha_1) = D(x_a + ip_a)$\\n- 2nd mode (P2): $D(\\\\alpha_2) = D(x_b + ip_b)$\\n- 3rd mode (P2): $D(\\\\alpha_3) = D(x_b + ip_b)$, since both the 2nd and 3rd modes are encoded by P2.\\n- 4th mode (P3): $D(\\\\alpha_4) = D(x_c + ip_c)$\\n\\n## Step 3: Perform the Bell measurement\\nA Bell measurement on these states effectively projects the combined state onto a Bell state basis.

Considering the nature of Bell measurements and the encoding scheme, the correct representation should involve operations (addition or subtraction) on the amplitudes and phases that reflect the correlations induced by the measurement.\\n\\nThe final answer is: $\\\\boxed{A}$\\n\\nTo solve this, we need to understand how the displacement operator \\\\(D(\\\\alpha)\\\\) affects the modes in a continuous variable quantum system and how a Bell measurement operates on these modes.\\n\\nGiven that the 2nd and 3rd modes are encoded by P2 and the 1st and 4th modes are encoded by P1 and P3, respectively, we need to consider the effect of the displacement operators on these modes. The displacement operator \\\\(D(\\\\alpha)\\\\) displaces the quantum state in phase space by \\\\(\\\\alpha = x + ip\\\\), where \\\\(x\\\\) is the amplitude (quadrature) and \\\\(p\\\\) is the phase (momentum).\\n\\nA Bell measurement on two modes, which is essentially a measurement in the Bell basis, projects the two modes onto one of the four Bell states. For continuous variable systems, this can be thought of as measuring the sum and difference of the quadratures of the two modes involved.\\n\\nGiven the encoding:\\n- P1 encodes the 1st and 4th modes with \\\\((x_a, p_a)\\\\),\\n- P2 encodes the 2nd and 3rd modes with \\\\((x_b, p_b)\\\\),\\n- P3 encodes with \\\\((x_c, p_c)\\\\) on the 4th mode (in conjunction with P1),\\n\\nWhen performing a Bell measurement on these encoded modes, we are interested in the correlations between the modes. The measurement outcomes will reflect the relative displacements between the modes.\\n\\nFor a Bell measurement between the 1st and 2nd modes (encoded by P1 and P2), and between the 3rd and 4th modes (also involving P2 and P3), the measurement outcomes would reflect the differences in their displacements.\\n\\nThus, the measurement outcomes would be related to:\\n- The difference in amplitude and phase between the modes encoded by P1 and P2 for the first part of the measurement: \\\\((x_a - x_b, p_a - p_b)\\\\).\\n- The difference in amplitude and phase between the modes encoded by P2 and P3 for the second part of the measurement: \\\\((x_b - x_c, p_b - p_c)\\\\).\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer, based on the description of the encoding and the nature of a Bell measurement in continuous variable systems, is:\\n\\nA) \\\\((x_a - x_b, p_a - p_b), (x_b - x_c, p_b - p_c)\\\\)\\n\\nThis reflects the differences in the displacements applied by P1, P2, and P3 to their respective modes, as would be measured in a Bell measurement scenario.\\n\\nTo determine the measurement output in a quantum dialog protocol where a 4-mode continuous variable GHZ state is distributed among 3 parties, and a Bell measurement is performed on these states, let's break down the encoding process and the effect of the displacement operator $D(\\\\alpha)$.\\n\\nGiven that each party encodes their information using a displacement operator $D(\\\\alpha)$, where $\\\\alpha = x + ip$, with $x$ and $p$ corresponding to the amplitude and phase, respectively, we can consider how the modes are encoded:\\n\\n- P1 encodes the 1st and 4th modes.\\n- P2 encodes the 2nd and 3rd modes.\\n- P3 encodes (the question implies involvement but doesn't specify the modes; based on the pattern, it seems P3 would be involved with one of the modes not directly stated, but for the purpose of this question, we focus on the provided encoding).\\n\\nThe displacement operator $D(\\\\alpha)$ acting on a state effectively displaces the state in phase space by $\\\\alpha$. In the context of continuous variable quantum information, the encoding and decoding processes involve applying displacement operations to the modes of the shared GHZ state.\\n\\nFor the Bell measurement on a 4-mode GHZ state where the modes are encoded by different parties, the measurement outcomes are related to the relative phases and amplitudes between the modes. The specific encoding and measurement outcomes depend on the implementation details, such as how the displacement operators are applied to the modes and how the Bell measurement is performed.\\n\\nHowever, based on the provided options and understanding that the displacement operator affects the quadratures (amplitude and phase) of the modes, we can infer the following:\\n\\n- When two modes are encoded by different parties and measured jointly (as in a Bell measurement), the measurement outcome reflects the difference or sum of their encoding parameters (amplitude and phase), depending on the specific measurement setup.\\n\\nGiven the options:\\n\\nA) $(x_a - x_b, p_a - p_b), (x_b - x_c, p_b - p_c)$\\n\\nB) $(x_a + x_b, p_a + p_b), (x_b + x_c, p_b + p_c)$\\n\\nC) $(x_a + x_b, p_a - p_b), (x_b + x_c, p_b - p_c)$\\n\\nD) $(x_a - x_b, p_a + p_b), (x_b - x_c, p_b + p_c)$\\n\\nThe correct option depends on understanding that in a typical Bell measurement setup for continuous variable systems, the measurement outcomes can reflect the sum or difference of the quadratures (amplitude and phase), depending on the relative phases of the modes being measured. \\n\\nFor continuous variable quantum systems, the Bell measurement often involves measuring the sum of the amplitude (or position) quadratures and the difference of the phase (or momentum) quadratures of two modes. This aligns with option:\\n\\nC) $(x_a + x_b, p_a - p_b), (x_b + x_c, p_b - p_c)$\\n\\nThis option correctly reflects the typical measurement outcomes for a Bell measurement on a 4-mode GHZ state, where the measurements are designed to detect the correlations between the modes encoded by different parties.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\\n\\nC) $(x_a + x_b, p_a - p_b), (x_b + x_c, p_b - p_c)$\\n\\n## Step 1: Understanding the Encoding Scheme\\nThe problem describes a quantum dialog protocol involving a 4-mode continuous variable GHZ state distributed among 3 parties.

Party 1 (P1) encodes the 1st and 4th modes, Party 2 (P2) encodes the 2nd and 3rd modes, and Party 3 (P3) also encodes the 1st and 4th modes but with different parameters.\\n\\n## Step 2: Analyzing the Measurement Process\\nIn a Bell measurement on a continuous variable system, the measurement outcomes can be related to the differences in the amplitude and phase quadratures of the modes being measured. For two modes with amplitudes \\\\(x_1\\\\) and \\\\(x_2\\\\), and phases \\\\(p_1\\\\) and \\\\(p_2\\\\), a Bell measurement would effectively measure combinations of \\\\(x_1 - x_2\\\\) and \\\\(p_1 - p_2\\\\) or \\\\(x_1 + x_2\\\\) and \\\\(p_1 + p_2\\\\), depending on the specific implementation and the relative phases of the modes.\\n\\n## Step 3: Applying the Encoding to the Measurement\\nGiven that P1 encodes \\\\((x_a, p_a)\\\\), P2 encodes \\\\((x_b, p_b)\\\\), and P3 encodes \\\\((x_c, p_c)\\\\), and considering the modes each party acts on, we need to determine the correct combination of these parameters that would result from a Bell measurement.\\n\\n## Step 4: Determining the Correct Combination\\nSince P2 encodes the 2nd and 3rd modes, and P1 and P3 encode the 1st and 4th modes, the measurement would involve comparing the encoded values between these modes. The question hints at a comparison between the modes encoded by P1 and P2, and between P2 and P3.\\n\\n## Step 5: Identifying the Measurement Output\\nThe correct measurement output should reflect the differences or sums in amplitude and phase between the modes as encoded by the parties. Considering the standard operations involved in Bell measurements and the encoding scheme, the most likely combinations involve either the sum or difference of the amplitudes and phases.\\n\\n## Step 6: Selecting the Correct Answer\\nGiven the above analysis, the measurement output should logically reflect the operations that are typically involved in a Bell measurement, which often involve either the sum or difference of the quadratures (amplitude and phase) of the involved modes.\\n\\nThe final answer is: $\\\\boxed{A}$\",\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrated an implementation of MAS-Zero using the agenticblocks framework. Key takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **MAS-Init** provides diverse initial answers using established prompting strategies (Chain of Thought, Self-Consistency, Multi-Agent Debate, Self-Refine)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **MAS-Evolve** iteratively refines solutions through:\n",
    "   - Task decomposition by the meta-agent\n",
    "   - Feedback on solvability and completeness\n",
    "   - Experience accumulation across iterations\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **MAS-Verify** uses majority voting to select the final answer from all candidates\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike ADAS, MAS-Zero operates on each question independently without requiring a validation dataset for meta-learning. This makes it particularly suited for scenarios where labeled validation data is unavailable.\n",
    "\n",
    "For better results, consider:\n",
    "- Increasing the number of MAS-Evolve iterations\n",
    "- Using more diverse building blocks in MAS-Init\n",
    "- Fine-tuning the meta-design and meta-feedback prompts for your specific domain\n"
